/*The Tweet model is used to represent a Tweet object from Twitter's API, and stores the attributes of the Tweet object as attributes of the class. The Tweet object is initialized from the dictionary sent by Twitter's API that represents a User object. There is also a method to initialize many tweets from a list of Tweet dictionaries.*/
